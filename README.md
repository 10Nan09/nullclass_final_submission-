## Introduction
This internship with NullClass focused on enhancing data visualization, dashboard development, and time-based interactive features. The main project involved integrating multiple charts into a responsive dashboard while applying complex data filters and conditional displays.  

The goal was to strengthen data analysis, visualization, and web deployment skills while implementing time-based conditional displays. All tasks were designed to simulate real-world analytics and dashboard development scenarios.

---

## Background
Data-driven decision-making is essential for organizations to track job listings, preferences, and candidate demographics. The project allowed building a dashboard where users could filter jobs based on multiple criteria such as work type, experience, country, salary, qualifications, and job portal.  

Time-based conditional chart display ensures that certain data is only visible during specific hours, enhancing user experience and simulating real-world data accessibility constraints.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply advanced data filtering and preprocessing  
- Build interactive charts and dashboards  
- Implement time-based visibility for charts  
- Integrate interactive maps for geographic data visualization  
- Ensure responsive design across devices  
- Enhance problem-solving, self-learning, and research skills
